To Do List

* Mailer that notifies me if an error was encountered such as 404 and especially 500.
* Give details of the error in the email.
* How to test error 500 pages
* Add disqu comments and specs
* Posts#index shows if a post has been published or not
* Expand and collapsable menu bar.
* Have the sidebars be fixed when user is scrolling.

NICE TO HAVE
* A better way for tests to switch dynamically between consider_all_local_requests
* Ideally, it only gives error messages if an admin is not signed in
